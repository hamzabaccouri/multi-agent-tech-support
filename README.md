# Agentic Technical Support System

A multi-agent AI-powered technical support system that simulates interaction between a user and two collaborative AI agents.

- **Agent A**: A first-line support agent that interacts with users.
- **Agent B**: A technical expert agent leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for detailed technical solutions.

---

## Project Overview

This system consists of:

1. **Agent A**:  
   - First-line support agent that interacts with users and determines when technical expertise is needed.

2. **Agent B**:  
   - A technical expert agent leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
   - Utilizes a **Chroma vector database** in combination with **LangChain** to access relevant information from a knowledge base.  
   - The knowledge base consists of synthetic Q&A data generated by a custom script and stored locally in the `TechAssistDB` directory.

3. **Synthetic Data Generator**:  
   - Creates bilingual (EN/FR) technical support Q&A datasets.

4. **Streamlit Interface**:  
   - User-friendly web interface with chat history and session management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzabaccouri/multi-agent-tech-support.git
   cd multi-agent-tech-support
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:  
   - **Windows**:  
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Linux/Mac**:  
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:  
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Optional

### Generate the Knowledge Base  
If you want to regenerate the synthetic Q&A data:
1. Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   python SyntheticDataGenerator/data_generator.py
   ```
2. The generated data will be stored in the `synthetic_data` directory. Agent B will use this data to populate the Chroma vector database.

## Running the Application

1. **Test the Agents**:  
   - Test **Agent B**:  
     ```bash
     python testAgentB.py
     ```
   - Test **Agents A & B** together:  
     ```bash
     python testAgents.py
     ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App**:  
   - Start the Streamlit-based web application:  
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - The application will be available at:  
     [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Features

- **Bilingual Support**: English and French
- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Seamless interaction between Agent A and Agent B
- **RAG-Based Knowledge Retrieval**: Accurate and relevant technical answers
- **Chat History Management**: Save and load previous conversations
- **Professional Web Interface**: Simple and intuitive design

---

## Development Notes and Assumptions

- **Agent A**: Handles initial user interactions and uses confidence scoring to determine when to consult **Agent B**.  
- **RAG System**: Utilizes Chroma as the vector store, optimized for technical support documentation, with separate English and French knowledge bases.  
- **Streamlit**: Chosen for rapid deployment and a user-friendly interface.  
- **Logging**: Both agents log their activities in the `logs` folder, with daily log files.  

---

## Limitations

- Requires an OpenAI API Key
- Supports English and French only

---

## Python Version

The code has been tested with **Python 3.9+**.
