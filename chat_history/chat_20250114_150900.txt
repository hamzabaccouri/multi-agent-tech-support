The system shows high memory usage (around 90%), and I'm getting 'OutOfMemoryError' in the logs. I've already tried increasing the JVM heap size to 8GB but the issue persists. The CPU usage also spikes to 100% during these operations. What could be causing this and how can I optimize the application?

The specific version of SQL Server we're using is 2019 Enterprise. Can you help troubleshoot this integration issue?
